// JavaScript Variables:-
// Variables are Containers for Storing Data.
// JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

/*
Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const
*/

// In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

// They are automatically declared when first used:

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
console.log(z);

// Note:- It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

// Example using var

var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

// Note:-
// The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
// The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

// Example using let

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

// Example using const

const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;
